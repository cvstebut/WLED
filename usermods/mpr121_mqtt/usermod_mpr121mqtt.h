/*
 * Usermods allow you to add own functionality to WLED more easily
 * See: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/Add-own-functionality
 * 
 * This is an example for a v2 usermod.
 * v2 usermods are class inheritance based and can (but don't have to) implement more functions, each of them is shown in this example.
 * Multiple v2 usermods can be added to one compilation easily.
 * 
 * Creating a usermod:
 * This file serves as an example. If you want to create a usermod, it is recommended to use usermod_v2_empty.h from the usermods folder as a template.
 * Please remember to rename the class and file to a descriptive name.
 * You may also use multiple .h and .cpp files.
 * 
 * Using a usermod:
 * 1. Copy the usermod into the sketch folder (same folder as wled00.ino)
 * 2. Register the usermod by adding #include "usermod_filename.h" in the top and registerUsermod(new MyUsermodClass()) in the bottom of usermods_list.cpp
